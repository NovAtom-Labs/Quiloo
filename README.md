> **Alpha software:** Agent Kronig 0.1.0 Alpha 5 is an early research pilot. Packages are currently unsigned, updates are manual, and scientific output must be reviewed by a qualified researcher before it informs device, process, or fabrication decisions.

## Download the native application

Agent Kronig is a self-contained Native desktop application. A release includes the private local backend, the repository agent, and the reviewed DEVSIM runtime. End users do not need Python, Node.js, Electron, DEVSIM, or a browser.

## What Agent Kronig does

Agent Kronig combines an agentic repository IDE with a constrained scientific execution system:

- Opens a local Git or non-Git repository and edits its real files.
- Maintains persistent conversations, task state, approvals, activity, and run-scoped changes.
- Reads, previews, and safely edits code, text, Markdown, JSON, CSV, TSV, images, and PDFs.
- Runs allowlisted repository commands and deterministic validation inside the selected workspace.
- Delegates bounded analysis or review to registered specialist agents while one primary agent owns the final write sequence.
- Converts research intent into a strict, simulator-neutral `ExperimentSpec`.
- Checks a backend capability manifest before generating any simulator input.
- Compiles supported DEVSIM and Sentaurus jobs through deterministic adapters.
- Normalizes simulator output into canonical result fields and validates numerical evidence.
- Builds reports and evidence bundles with versions, hashes, simulator identity, and validation provenance.
- Retrieves reviewed TCAD context with source metadata and citations.

The selected repository is the default authority boundary. Repository-local reads, edits, tests, and validation are allowed by policy. External paths, network activity, package installation, destructive commands, Git mutation, and remote mutation require an explicit approval. Category approval applies only to the current run.

## Research workflow

```

The language model interprets intent and operates tools. It is not the authority for units, simulator syntax, supported physics, or numerical acceptance. Schemas, capability manifests, adapters, runners, and validators own those decisions.

## Current capabilities

| Area | Alpha capability |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | Native three-pane repository, file, chat, activity, and changes interface |
| Agent runtime | Persistent OpenHands execution, repository file tools, bounded terminal commands, tasks, approvals, and delegated agents |
| Scientific contract | Strict one-dimensional `ExperimentSpec` with dimensional quantities and unknown-field rejection |
| Geometry | Ordered, contiguous silicon regions described as data, without named-device branches |
| Doping | Constant donor and acceptor profiles |
| Studies | Equilibrium and bounded DC sweeps |
| DEVSIM | Local deterministic compilation, execution, normalization, validation, reporting, and evidence bundles |
| Sentaurus | Deterministic command compilation, source maps, signed remote protocol, canonical result contract, and conformance rules |
| Knowledge | Manifest-gated retrieval with review state, backend/version filters, hashes, source metadata, and citations |
| Results | Interactive spatial fields, metrics, samples, validation checks, structure details, and evidence downloads |
| Provenance | Source versions, hashes, compiler identity, simulator identity, validation records, and atomic bundle manifests |

### Backend boundary

| Capability | DEVSIM pilot | Sentaurus adapter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execution | Local and packaged | Disabled until a licensed host passes integration checks |
| Dimension | 1D | 1D |
| Material | Silicon | Silicon |
| Regions | Up to 32 ordered regions | Up to 32 ordered regions |
| Contacts | Two endpoint ohmic contacts | Endpoint ohmic or explicit metal work-function contacts |
| Statistics | Boltzmann | Boltzmann or Fermi |
| Mobility | Constant | Constant and reviewed Sentaurus mappings |
| Recombination | SRH | SRH and Auger |
| Band-gap narrowing | Unsupported | Supported by the adapter contract |
| Studies | Equilibrium and DC sweep, up to 10 points | Equilibrium and DC sweep, up to 10 points |

Unsupported physics is refused. It is never silently approximated or removed from the research request.

## Known limitations

This alpha is for workflow evaluation and small exploratory drift-diffusion studies. It is not a calibrated fabrication prediction system.

- One spatial dimension, silicon only, constant doping profiles, and two endpoint contacts.
- No arbitrary model-written simulator syntax.
- No process simulation, transient analysis, AC, noise, optical, thermal, mechanical, quantum, hydrodynamic, ballistic, or circuit co-simulation.
- No automated calibration against fabrication measurements.
- DEVSIM does not cover metal work functions, Fermi statistics, Auger, band-gap narrowing, band diagrams, mobility output, or recombination output in the reviewed local adapter.
- Licensed Sentaurus execution remains unavailable until a separate host, exact simulator version, extractor, signing keys, quotas, and conformance cases are configured and verified.
- Windows and macOS can warn about unsigned alpha packages.
- Updates are manual for this alpha.
- Repository commands run as the current operating-system user. The alpha does not provide a VM or per-researcher OS sandbox.

Adding a new material, model, profile, contact, study, or observable requires a schema decision, capability declaration, deterministic adapter mapping, normalization, validation, and tests. A new structure that already fits the portable concepts should require only data, not a named product path.

## Architecture

The stable product boundary is the experiment and evidence workflow. DEVSIM and Sentaurus are replaceable backends.

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `domain` | `ExperimentSpec`, units, geometry, profiles, contacts, physics, studies, and requested observables |
| `capabilities` | Exact backend support, resource limits, refusal reasons, and execution availability |
| `knowledge` | Authorized ingestion, retrieval, review metadata, and citations |
| `adapters` | Deterministic simulator input generation and native result normalization |
| `runners` | Bounded local execution and signed licensed-host submission |
| `validation` | Numerical, physical, conservation, provenance, and completeness checks |
| `bundles` | Atomic reports, manifests, artifacts, and SHA-256 hashes |
| `agent` | OpenHands tools, repository policy, normalized events, and bounded delegation |
| `ide` | Workspaces, conversations, runs, approvals, messages, activity, and changes |
| `desktop` | Electron-owned native window, authenticated private loopback backend, and packaged sidecars |

Every simulator adapter implements the same conceptual boundary:

```python
manifest -> CapabilityManifest
compile(spec, workspace) -> CompiledJob
normalize(native_run) -> CanonicalResult
```

Read the [architecture document](docs/architecture.md) for the full contract and [desktop operations guide](docs/operations/desktop-application.md) for data locations, recovery, and packaging.

## Develop from source

Source development uses the same native Electron application as an installed release. There is no supported standalone browser interface.

Prerequisites are Python 3.13, Node.js 24, pnpm 11.19, Git, and a graphical desktop session. Then:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NovAtom-Labs/Quiloo.git
cd Quiloo
python3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pip install . --no-deps
pnpm --dir desktop install --frozen-lockfile
scripts/run_desktop_dev.sh
```

The launcher loads an ignored local `.env`, starts Electron, and lets Electron supervise the authenticated private backend. Credentials, proprietary Sentaurus material, private signing keys, and licensed examples must never be committed.

For the full setup, DEVSIM environment, Bedrock configuration, validation, and test-workspace procedure, follow [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

## Verify a checkout

```bash
OPENHANDS_SUPPRESS_BANNER=1 .venv/bin/pytest -q
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests scripts
.venv/bin/mypy --strict src
pnpm --dir desktop test
.venv/bin/python scripts/sync_requirements.py --check
git diff --check
```

Live Bedrock and licensed Sentaurus tests are opt-in. Ordinary local verification does not require either service.
